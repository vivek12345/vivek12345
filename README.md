# 👋 Hi, I'm Vivek Nayyar

### 🚀 Engineering Leader | 🧠 AI Builder

I’m an engineering leader and hands-on AI/ML builder, focused on deeply understanding and implementing the nuts and bolts of modern LLMs. From **training tokenizers** and **building BPE from scratch**, to **implementing transformers line-by-line**, I love demystifying AI—one project and one workshop at a time.



## 🧠 Projects & Experiments

| Project | What I Did |
|--------|------------|
| 🧩 **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) from Scratch** | Wrote a custom BPE tokenizer in Python with support for special tokens, regex splitting, and vocab merging. |
| 🧠 **LLM from Scratch** | Implemented a transformer-based LLM (embedding → attention → MLP → logits) using only PyTorch. Includes training loop, sampling, and inference. |
| 🦙 **Agentic RAG Pipeline** | Built end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflows using LangChain, DuckDB, FAISS, and streaming token-by-token inference. |
| 📊 **Text-to-SQL for CSVs** | Built a system to parse natural language queries into SQL and run them over uploaded CSVs. Added Vespa-style search for LIKE queries. |
| 🇮🇳 **Hindi Tokenizer** *(WIP)* | Training a BPE tokenizer from scratch on Hindi corpora to enable better subword tokenization for Indian languages. |
| 🔐 **Secure LLM Workflows** | Integrated Cloudflare Zero Trust, IP whitelisting, and API key validation in LangChain-based pipelines. |
| 📦 **SmartInvestReturns** | A personal finance site to calculate SIP, retirement corpus, and mutual fund strategies. Built with Next.js & TypeScript. |
